## Hello!

Decided to start a website using Thuong's website as a baseline. A lot of stuff to learn from scratch. The setup of the site is basically a github page with leapyear as the template.

So far the way I understand how the site is structured:
The default homepage is in index.md. Pages are made by creating a .md file in any directory. To get to that page, you must link into it somehow with (brackets and links). Images are done very similarly with (! brackets and links). Can't figure out how to add it without the function.
