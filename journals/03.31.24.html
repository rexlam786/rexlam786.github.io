    Seeing as this is a bit different than the other entries shows that the html
    and css is still definitely a work in progress. However, I did manage to figure
    out how to get the basics working. I got a template called astromotion and one
    from w3. My homepage got a lot better, but still not finished yet. I definitely
    still have much more to do, polishing the homepage, finishing up the journal/blog
    idea is definitely high on that list. <br> <br>

    I have a nice stash of some good html template files for some basic concepts. Things
    like box model stuff, forms, selectors, audio/visual, etc. all help out quite a bit.
    I also have a couple of different .css files for different types of pages which I think
    is how it should be done. The goal is to have template files where I can just pull one
    up and instantly use for whatever purpose I want. <br> <br>

    I also have a general idea of how to edit css and html files to suit my needs.
    But making one from scratch seems pretty impossible still. Hopefully using basic
    templates is fine. After enough modifications I suppose it'll be pretty much my
    own, but I really do think I need a starting point. <br> <br>

    The blog post concept is also coming along nicely. The goal is to eventually be
    able to make these posts not in the text editor but directly on the website. This
    will probably make use of forms, maybe some js, and other stuff I don't even know
    about yet. Looking forward to learning it all. Seems pretty overwhelming right now
    though.
