    <h2> Website Updates </h2>

    Just a reminder and a reference that should I wish to locally host the site, before the full commit to Github, I must open a CMD prompt, navigate to the directory of rexlam786.github.io, then type jekyll serve. This can only be done after installing jekyll and ruby.

    Also, quick walkthrough on the editing process of the site. Typically pages are editted and added through a text editor - in this case, it's Atom. I can locally host it by using Jekyll and Ruby. Once I am comfortable with the day's work, I stage all the changes, commit it to the master, and push the commit through to Github.

    Made some changes to the front page.

    <h2> Career Updates </h2>

    The paper is going okay. Hopefully the analysis will be done this week. If so, all that's left to do is to write the paper itself. Still not sure if I want to make this a full paper or decide to write a small proceeding paper and a full fledge paper to a journal afterwards.

    <h2> Life Updates </h2>

    Made some nice plans for Japan, and it should be documented in the site as well, along with itineraries, etc. Shahraz might join as well for the trip.
