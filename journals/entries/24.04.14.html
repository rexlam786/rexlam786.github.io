    No entry last week cuz I was being lazy. This week honestly isn't that much
    better. Unless something changes in the next couple hours. I'll make a decent
    post this time though. Going to start putting website updates here as well
    as a weekly update of life, work, gaming?, etc.


    <br>

    <h2>Website Updates </h2>

      Lot of issues that I haven't been able to figure out yet. Most notably, is
      that the journal entries are still being done on Atom. I want to eventually
      do this all directly on the site itself and dynamically generate pages based
      on the entry itself. This also goes for the journal_home_page as well. It
      in theory should auto-update whenever I put a post up.

      <br><br>

      I've also started working on updating research! So far I have an brief overview complete with papers about the history of the temperature anisotropy research of the cosmic microwave background. The plan is to add a little more about power spectrums, E and B modes, and the Hubble tension. Then once the overview is done, I can relate it to the work I'm currently doing at the University of Minnesota. If possible, I want to also bring in the work I was doing with Doug Leonard about &Lambda CDM. Then eventually work on updating the work for binary stars and BCGs as well. This way I can have a nice reference to all the research I've ever done and the background for each field regardless of what subfield I end up in. It's also a nice way to consolidate papers that I feel are important and can easily reference. In retrospect I should have split CMB and laser ablation, but oh well. 

    <h2>Career Updates </h2>

    <p>
      Nhi is about to take her STEP 1 Exam soon, so it's cram time. She's pretty
      unconfident in her chances so it's still up in the air, if she'll actually
      end up taking her exam in the beginning of May.
      <br> <br>

      We will be going to Japan in July for two weeks, so that'll be interesting.
      Tickets have already been bought so it's set in stone now. Perhaps I'll post
      some pictures from that here. I'll have to figure out how to re-implement
      the image wheel on html.
      <br> <br>

      In terms of actual work, it's going okay. Laser ablation has been pretty
      good. There are some confusing aspects due to lack of repeatability but
      nothing crazy. The paper has not yet been written or even close. Shaul
      doesn't seem to be too worried about it. I should make a little more progress
      this week on that and hopefully actually

    <h2> Life </h2>

    <p> Didn't play much smash this week. Got top 8 after beating sushi and uckle
      last week. But went 2-2 after a campy John and time out Pale beat me this week.
      Gotta work on my clutch factor. Also, need to start looking at the opponent
      more, what do they do during disadvantage? If I'm ledge trapping them in the
      corner, do they jump out, roll, mash, or shield? I have options to punish everything
      but I just fully commit to one without any prior knowledge. I think figuring
      this out is the next step for me. So I think I need to try playing some good
      players, get them in a tense situation like corner pressure, or juggling, and
      just waiting and figuring out what their habits are. Hopefully that'll help.

      <br> <br>

      Managed to finally beat MH:Rise Sunbreak. Got through 3 credit scenes, and gone through
      Gaismagorm. Might consider going further and getting to Primordial Malzeno, etc.
      But pretty satisfied with how far I've gotten. Bought AC Valhalla <em>and </em>
      Watch Dog: Legion for $21! That's pretty crazy deal, and hopefully AC Valhalla
      will match up to my expectations. So far, it's better than I remember.

      <br><br>

      Been going through a FE:3H Let's Play for the last month or so. Turns out I don't
      really like SRPGs. But I want to know the story, so watching seemed like a good
      compromise. It's also nice to watch in the background. Thought about and tried
      a run of maddening, but I think there's just too much openness in choices in these
      games that makes me not like it.
