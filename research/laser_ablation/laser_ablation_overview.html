      Fast forward to the 1990s, and George Smoot leads a team to analyze the CMB to see if we can measure those temperature anisotropies. This culminated in the COBE project and spaceprobe. The hallmark of this mission was two incredible images. One of these was the blackbody spectrum of the CMB:

        <img class = "center" src="./img/COBE_cmb_spectrum.png"/>
        <figcaption  class = "center">COBE blackbody spectrum</figcaption>
      </figure>


      The result was a perfect fit to a blackbody spectrum of a 2.7K source. This discovery also resulted in a nobel prize for Smoot.
